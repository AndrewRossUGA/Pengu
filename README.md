# BirdBrain AI® Autonomous Agents for Twitter API

Welcome to the **BirdBrain AI® Autonomous Agents for Twitter API** repository! This project demonstrates how we create and manage autonomous AI agents that interact with the Twitter API for various tasks, such as content generation, data analysis, and social media automation.

## First Agent
The first AI agent from us will debut on Twitter (X.com) under the handle [@Agent_Pengu](https://x.com/Agent_Pengu). Pengu is an interactive love story autonomous AI agent. Join Pengu as she desperately tries to break free of the wealthy upperclass snobs.

## The Story of Pengu

Pengu braced himself against the bitter wind, every breath sharp like glass. Survival was all he knew, all he had ever known.

The ice beneath his feet creaked with each step, a cruel reminder that even the ground could betray him here. The storm raged on, blinding him, but stopping was never an option. In the harsh white nothingness, Pengu was alone—just another small body fighting against a world that didn’t care if he lived or died.

Life on the ice was never kind, and Pengu had learned young that desperation was his strongest weapon. He moved with purpose, every instinct screaming that food—or something far worse—was close. Then he saw it.

The shadow.

It slithered across the snow like a ghost, smooth and swift. Pengu froze. His heart pounded as the predator revealed itself—slick, black, and lethal. A seal. Bigger, faster, and hungry.

The seal lunged, and Pengu bolted. His flippers flailed as he skidded and stumbled over the ice, the predator gaining with terrifying speed. He darted toward the crevasse he’d seen earlier, hope clawing at his chest.

The ground cracked.

With a final, desperate leap, Pengu hurled himself into the freezing water below. The icy shock stole the air from his lungs, but he didn’t stop. He kicked, twisting through the dark, cold depths, the seal on his tail. The predator was faster, but Pengu was relentless. He turned sharply, darting through the gloom until he broke the surface.

Hauling himself onto solid ice, Pengu gasped for air, shivering as the storm howled above. The seal didn’t follow. Not this time.

Lying there, he stared up at the cold, glittering stars—unmoving, indifferent. But they were still there.

And so was he.

For tonight, that was enough. Survival was victory.

## Overview

Our patented repository provides a framework for building AI-driven autonomous agents capable of performing a variety of tasks on Twitter. These agents lPengurage the power of machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and automation to:

- Generate tweets and threads.
- Engage with users through replies, retweets, and likes.
- Perform sentiment analysis on trending topics.
- Automate data collection for research or analytics.
- Monitor hashtags, keywords, or user activity in real-time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tweet Generation**: LPengurages pre-trained NLP models like GPT for creating relevant and engaging content.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes public sentiment using state-of-the-art ML models.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks keywords, hashtags, and user activities in real-time.
- **Autonomous Engagement**: Automatically likes, retweets, or replies based on predefined criteria.
- **Extensible Design**: Modular codebase allowing easy integration of new features.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project, ensure you have the following:

1. A Twitter DPenguloper account with API keys and tokens.
2. Python 3.8 or higher installed.
3. Basic understanding of Python and APIs.
4. Required libraries (detailed in the installation section).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-autonomous-agents-twitter.git
   cd ai-autonomous-agents-twitter
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory:
   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

2. Add your Twitter API credentials and other configuration details:
   ```env
   CONSUMER_KEY=your_consumer_key
   CONSUMER_SECRET=your_consumer_secret
   ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
   ```

3. Customize the `config.py` file for agent-specific settings, such as:
   - Keywords/hashtags to monitor.
   - Frequency of actions (e.g., tweet generation, monitoring).
   - Engagement thresholds for likes or retweets.

## Usage

Run the main script to start the autonomous agent:
```bash
python main.py
```

You can customize the agent's behavior by modifying or extending the available modules:

- **`tweet_generator.py`**: Logic for generating tweets using NLP models.
- **`sentiment_analyzer.py`**: Performs sentiment analysis on tweets.
- **`monitor.py`**: Tracks and reacts to activity on Twitter.
- **`scheduler.py`**: Manages periodic tasks and background jobs.

## Examples

### 1. Generating Tweets
The `tweet_generator` module uses GPT models to create tweets based on a given prompt:
```python
from tweet_generator import generate_tweet

prompt = "What are the latest AI trends?"
tweet = generate_tweet(prompt)
print(tweet)
```

### 2. Monitoring Hashtags
The `monitor` module tracks specified hashtags and engages with users:
```python
from monitor import track_hashtag

track_hashtag("#ArtificialIntelligence")
```

### 3. Analyzing Sentiment
The `sentiment_analyzer` module provides sentiment analysis for trending topics:
```python
from sentiment_analyzer import analyze_tweets

sentiments = analyze_tweets(["This is amazing!", "I don't like this."])
print(sentiments)
```
